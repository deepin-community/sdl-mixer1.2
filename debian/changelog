  * Team upload.
  * Add Breaks: libfluidsynth1 (<< 1.1.7~) to make sure we have a
    version of that library available that supports the SF3 soundfont

    alternative provider of sf3-soundfont-gm and use the default
    soundfont throughout the package.

  * Drop Build-Depends on "dpkg-dev (>= 1.16.1~)", it is very old and
    satisfied everywhere

  * Bump Policy Standards-Version to 3.9.5 (no changes needed)
  * Regenerate with dh_autoreconf without using upstream's autogen.sh
  * debian/patches:
    - Disable bug-694260-freedink_stack_corruption.patch, it is not fixing
      #694260 while introducing new problems (Closes: #726912)
  * Build-depend on libsmpeg-dev even if not using it, to avoid having to
    use possibly obsolete local smpeg.m4 file

sdl-mixer1.2 (1.2.12-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modify bug-715461-soundfont_paths.patch again to delete memory allocated
    dynamically, otherwise it leaks memory when Mix_Init() is called repeatedly
    (not the normal way in which the library is used, but it happens for example
    with test cases in libsdl-perl, see #718129 and #715461).  Thanks Fabian
    Greffrath for keeping track of this and suggesting the new fix.

 -- Manuel A. Fernandez Montecelo <mafm@debian.org>  Wed, 09 Oct 2013 19:22:03 +0100

sdl-mixer1.2 (1.2.12-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modify bug-715461-soundfont_paths.patch to add a string as dynamic memory,

 -- Dominique Dumont <dod@debian.org>  Wed, 07 Aug 2013 19:16:25 +0200

sdl-mixer1.2 (1.2.12-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * MIDI enhancements (Thanks Fabian Greffrath for the reports and the
    fixes):
    - Add the "--disable-music-fluidsynth-shared" parameter to ./configure so
      the library is linked to libfluidsynth instead of loaded through dlopen()
      at runtime (Closes: #715447).
    - Add patch bug-715461-soundfont_paths.patch and depend on "sf2" sound fonts
      to have good MIDI sounds by default (Closes: #715461).

 -- Manuel A. Fernandez Montecelo <mafm@debian.org>  Thu, 11 Jul 2013 12:17:15 +0100

sdl-mixer1.2 (1.2.12-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adding patch (bug-694260-freedink_stack_corruption.patch) backported from
    upstream, to protect against stack corruption when midi file has more than
    16 channels (Closes: #694260).  Thanks Bas Wijnen for the report and
    analysis.
  * Recommend midi patch set (Closes: #700375).  Thanks Fabian Greffrath.

sdl-mixer1.2 (1.2.12-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bring back the unnecessary dependencies previously dropped by Felix Geyer,
    only present in experimental.  This solution is preferred for the time
    being, rather than start branching because of this kind of changes.  We
    submitted bugs and provided experimental packages well before the freeze in
    order to help maintainers to fix the problems, but most packages depending
    and relying on this one to include these dependencies were not fixed in
    time.  Dependencies will be removed for good just after Wheezy is released.
  * Added patches:
    - bug-688369-double_free_crash.patch: Backport patch from upstream to fix
      crash caused by freeing the same memory region twice.  Thanks Philipp
      Klaus Krause for reporting and pointing to the fix (Closes: #688369).

  * Bump Policy Standards-Version to 3.9.3 (no changes needed)
  * Build-Depends on debhelper>=9~, quells lintian warning
    "package-needs-versioned-debhelper-build-depends 9"
  * Build-Depends and Depends on SDL with added ~ to the version number, in
    order to allow to work with backported/local versions
  * Adding lintian overrides for the slightly different names "libsdl-mixer1.2"
    and "libSDL-mixer-1.2-0" -- the package names are not going to change by now
    for the 1.2 series
  * Update debian/copyright format now that 1.0 is approved (quells lintian
    unversioned-copyright-format-uri)

sdl-mixer1.2 (1.2.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upsteam release
    - debian/copyright: Switch from LGPL to zlib/libpng license, and better
      document timidity (which is under 3 licenses, but primarily Artistic)
    - Native MIDI code removed upstream, making some bug reports not applicable
      now (Closes: #298982 #526908)
    - Incorporates patch to fix bug "timidity MIDI playback plays drums that
      should be musical notes" (Closes: #575575).  Thanks Matthew W. Miller

    - Supports fluidsynth and modplug, add to dependencies
  * Removed patches obsolete now (because of the removal of Native GPL MIDI
    code)
    - 03_awe_voice.patch
    - 06_dev_snd_seq.patch
  * Removed patches picked from/incorporated upstream:
    - 00_link_libm_hgdb31b63abab9.patch: "link libm with sdl-mixer"
    - 07_FLAC_SDL_RWops_memory_leaks.patch: "Fix memory leaks with FLAC"
  * Documented and refreshed the remaining patches:
    - 01_no_lvorbis_logg.patch

    - Build for multiarch.

  [ Manuel A. Fernandez Montecelo ]
  * Correct watch file, the previous one was detecting versions wrongly
  * Quell lintian warnings:

      libsdl-mixer1.2)
    - unused-license-paragraph-in-dep5-copyright (remove GPL-2 paragraph)

sdl-mixer1.2 (1.2.11-5) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Felix Geyer ]
  * Fix Vcs-Browser link.

  [ Manuel A. Fernandez Montecelo ]
  * debian/rules:
    - Issue "disable-*-shared" flags for 'configure' again, otherwise SDL_mixer
      library opens those libraries in a plugin-like way (with SDL_LoadObject),
      and dpkg-shlibdeps doesn't seem to generate the needed dependencies in the
      binary library package.

sdl-mixer1.2 (1.2.11-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable
  * Improvements in debian/rules:
    - Remove support for setting some autoconf options directly, newer debhelper
      takes care of this
    - Using dpkg-buildflags's options as base, and hardening on top, before
      preferred flags
  * Modifications to dependencies and build options:
    - Depending on newer dpkg-dev (quells lintian warning when using build
      hardening flags)
    - Removed Conflict-like dependencies (Breaks, Replaces) on
      libsdl-mixer{,1.0,1.1}-dev. They are more than 10 years old and not
      present in any of the last Debian releases, long unsupported.
    - Use libmad (GPL) instead of unmaintained smpeg (LGPL) for mp3 support
    - Stating more explicitly in debian/rules the options that we use to build
      the project
    - Drop --disable-shared options for the different plugins.  I couldn't find
      any reason for or against in the changelog, and the default is to enable
      this support.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.2 (no changes needed)
  * Remove previous Uploaders, all of them not active for years
  * Removed duplicated entry in previous version's changelog:
    - "debian/copyright: updated and converted to DEP-5 (dod)"

sdl-mixer1.2 (1.2.11-3) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #568445 #600467)
  * New maintainer
    - Add myself to uploaders, and setting DM-Upload-Allowed: yes
  * Incorporating changes from different sources, unreleased
    - Changing "Closes" lines to "Closes_in_1.2.11-3"
  * Changed debhelper compat to level 8 (level 5 before):
    - Updated dependency on debhelper to (>= 8.0.0)
    - Removed dependency on quilt
    - Simplify a lot debian/rules file by leveraging debhelper capabilities,
      only acting when deviating from auto behaviour
  * Added 'source/format', with '3.0 (quilt)'
    - Consequently, removed README.source
  * Added 'watch' file
  * Added Vcs-Git and Vcs-Browser in 'control' file
  * Shipping pkg-config files
  * Added FLAC support
  * Updated dependencies:
    - libsdl1.2-dev (>= 1.2.14) -- was (>= 1.2.4)
    - libsmpeg-dev (>= 0.4.5+cvs20030824-2.2) -- was (>= 0.4.5+cvs20030824-1.3)
    - libogg-dev (>= 1.2.0) -- was none
    - libvorbis-dev (>= 1.2.0) -- was (>= 1.0.0-3)
    - libmikmod2-dev (>= 3.1.11) -- was none
    - libflac-dev (>= 1.2.1) -- was none
  * Patches dropped:
    - 220_mixer_segfaults.diff (applied upstream)
    - 200_channel_segfaults.diff (now libmikmod ships in a zip, and it uses
      system's one anyway)
    - 00_mikmod_syslibs.patch (seemed to be related to remove tests in SDL_mixer
      of mikmod versions, probably this restriction is not applicable now, and
      it's safer to know what's SDL_mixer opinion about it anyway)
    - 00_link-libm.patch (substituted from another one from upstream)
    - 01_autoreconf.patch and 01_relibtoolize.patch (handled with dh_autoreconf)
    - 230_racecondition_hg884a700fb3ff.diff (applied upstream)
  * Patches added:
    - 00_link_libm_hgdb31b63abab9.patch (backport from upstream, grabbed by
      Roman Vasiyarov <rvasiyarov@gmail.com> on #600467, 1.2.11-2 UNRELEASED)
    - 07_FLAC_SDL_RWops_memory_leaks.patch (Jon Dowland <jmtd@debian.org>,
      1.2.11-1 UNRELEASED)
  * Patches renamed:
    - 00_no_lvorbis_logg.diff -> 01_no_lvorbis_logg.patch
    - 04_timidity_cfg_opts.diff -> 04_timidity_cfg_opts.patch
    - 05_fallback_to_freepats.diff -> 05_fallback_to_freepats.patch

sdl-mixer1.2 (1.2.1-2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU per maintainer's request
  * built against libsdl1.2-dev 1.2.2-3.3 and libsmpeg-dev 0.4.4-5
  * acinclude.m4: remove AC_DEFUNs for AM_PATH_SDL and AM_PATH_SMPEG so that
    the ones installed on the system (patched by Debian for static X extension
    library and SDL plugin support) are used
  * configure.in: remove LIBS from enable_music_mp3 test, because this should
    be $SMPEG_LIBS for the executables in this package and
    $SMPEG_LIBS_FOR_LIBS for the libraries; the proper linkage is hauled in by
    @SMPEG_LIBS@ and @SMPEG_LIBS_FOR_LIBS@ in Makefile.am anyway, so this bit
    of code seems redundant, and causes compile problems if left enabled
  * re-ran libtoolize --force --copy; aclocal; automake --foreign; autoconf
  * debian/control:
    - updated versioned Build-Depends to libsdl1.2-dev (>= 1.2.2-3.3) and
      libsmpeg-dev (>= 0.4.4-5)
    - updated versioned Depends of libsdl-mixer1.2-dev to libsdl1.2-dev (>=
      1.2.2-3.3)
